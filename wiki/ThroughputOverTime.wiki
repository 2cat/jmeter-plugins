= Transaction Throughput Over Time <sup><font color=gray size="1">since 0.2.1</font></sup>=

This listener will show the statistical average transaction throughtput over time. The formula to calculate the values is:
average(<active threads> x 1 second / <1 thread response time>)
So basically, it shows the statistical maximum possible number of transactions for the given scenario.

Here is an example. In the bellow graph, for the 'Search' transaction we can see that in the current scenario, we can go up to 120 transactions per second.
