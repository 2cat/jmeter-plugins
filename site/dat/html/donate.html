                                Of course, this is a parody on Wikipedia's personal appeals,
                                but, for a minute, let me explain you why I&nbsp;write these words.
                            </p>

                                JMeter Plugins project has grown from single &quot;Times vs Threads&quot;
                                graph into feature-rich bundle during last three years. Thousands of
                                users worldwide feel load testing more comfortable with these
                                JMeter Plugins. They ask for new features and find them implemented
                                soon and user-friendly. They ask for support and the answers come shortly
                                at our forums.
                            </p>

                                Me and other project contributors, we all steal the time for developing and
                                supporting the project from our families. It is pretty difficult to find
                                the reasons for our wives explaining why the comfort of another user somewhere 
                                in India or USA is more important than time spent with our children.
                            </p>

                                We are thankful for community appreciation, and we have much more ideas
                                to implement. But we need your support to
                                stay on the track, so we ask you to show
                                your support to us with a small donation.
